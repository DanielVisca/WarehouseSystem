All
  All variables should be private with getters/setters
    Double check the getters and setters are actually needed

  Verify translation table front/back sku

  Get list of unfinished jobs at end of day

Daniel
  Verify traversal table

  Take event, traversal and inventory file as main arg
    Zone input

  Look for design patterns

  Sequencer and Loader scanning and rescanning
    Sequencer has orders to scan each sku

Jamie
  *SKU to string (job)
  *Finalize logging (Ask about how its been consolidated..)
    ConsoleHandler
    FileHandler

  *Exception check in set status for existing job
  *Picker can catchs a false scan, tell them to pick right one again
    Exceptions

  Look for design patterns
  *Check loader order vs job manager job queue

Maggie
  UML
  SKU to string (location)
  Improve flexibility of Zones
    Zones need to be able to have any name
    Zones should allow for more flexibility in their dimensions
  Get rid of unjustified static classes 
    WarehousePicking is the only one, should be integrated into InventoryManager, FileHelper is fine if we write justification
