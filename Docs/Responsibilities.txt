Daniel

Jamie

  Finalize logging
    ConsoleHandler

  SKU to string (location)
  Improve flexibility of Zones
    Zones need to be able to have any name
    Zones should allow for more flexibility in their dimensions
  Get rid of unjustified static classes 
    WarehousePicking is the only one, should be integrated into InventoryManager, FileHelper is fine if we write justification
